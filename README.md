## SCOPE
This project data consists of 1M+ customer survey records from Hyatt Hotels in California for the month of August,2014. The goal was to analyze the data and provide suggestions to improve NPS (Net Promoters Score).

## UNDERSTANDING NPS (NET PROMOTERS SCORE)
When a company considers its reputation, it must determine how that reputation is created.  Since a company’s image is largely due to word of mouth of customers, Fred Reichheld devised a system to calculate what he termed as a Net Promoter Score®  (NPS®) (Bain & Company, 2017).  This system divides customers into three groups: Promoters, Passives, and Detractors (Bain & Company, 2017).  These groups are assigned following a survey asking how likely the customer is to recommend the company to someone else on a scale from zero to ten (Bain & Company, 2017).  Those who give a score of zero to six are Detractors, a score of seven or eight are from Passives, and a nine or ten indicate Promoters (Bain & Company, 2017).  The NPS® is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters (Bain & Company, 2017). Therefore, the score can range from -100 to +100 with a score above zero demonstrating the company has more Promoters than Detractors.  This score and the related survey questions can be beneficial in that they provide the company with possible explanations for why a customer likes or dislikes their business.  With this information, the company can be prepared to continue satisfying their Promoters and win over the Passives or Detractors. 

## BUSINESS QUESTIONS ANSWERED
1.	What factors should be considered while choosing the subset for analysis to achieve overall high NPS score?
2.	What is the effect of NPS on the Hotel Brand and Purpose of Visit?
3.	Which age group guests are most likely to recommend and who are least likely to recommend?
4.	On what factors do the ‘Likelihood to Recommend’ and ‘NPS Type’ have the highest dependency?
5.	What are the recommendations we can provide to improve the NPS score of Hyatt?

## SUGGESTIONS BASED ON ANALYSIS
1. Improving the Hotel Condition, Guest Room Condition and Customer Service as they directly impact the Net Promoter Score.
2. Improve the rooms ‘Guest Room King’ and ‘Guest Room Double,’ primarily in General Hyatt brand hotels.
3. Center the Hotel Promotional Activities towards the age groups of 26-35, 36-45, and 46-55 as the detractors seem to be concentrated in that group.
4. To improve the Hotel Condition, you can invest on improving facilities like Mini Bar, which will thereby have an impact on the NPS
